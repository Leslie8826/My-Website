            <p>44 minutes and 56 seconds as I look at my watch with proudness after completing the MURPH for time.</p>
            <p>As a reminder the MURPH in CrossFit is 1 mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, 1 mile run.</p>
            <p>I had that big smile on my face because 4 months earlier, I tried the MURPH for the first time. It was my
                second CrossFit session and it was very hard. The cap time to finish was 60 minutes. By the sixtieth minute
                I was still in the middle of the push-ups, exhausted. </p>
            <p> The day after this second CrossFit session, all of my muscles were so sore that I had a hard time doing
                the simplest moves. I recall thinking: "They are all crazy those CrossFitters!!!"</p>
            <p> Then I quickly shifted my mind into how I could do better for my next MURPH. I acknowledged that I was
                not prepared at all for such a high intensity training and focused on working on my weaknesses. </p>
